        Week 2: Building your own visualisation
    </h2>

<p> I used data I gathered in my data science module last year covering the UK's life expectancy and GDP per capita. Using vega lite I created two diagrams: 
    </p>

    <figure id="Location4"></figure> 

    </section>

 <script>
        

 let figure_4_spec = "GDPPC graph test"; 
                                                                                                                  
    vegaEmbed('#Location4', figure_4_spec)
    
 </script>

<p> Because my data for life expectancy was only between 65 and 85 I had to use domains to prevent a large unnecessary gap on my graph:
    </p>

    <figure id="Location5"></figure> 

    </section>

 <script>
        

 let figure_5_spec = "Life exp test"; 
                                                                                                                  
    vegaEmbed('#Location5', figure_5_spec)
    
 </script>

  <!-- WEEK 3 start -->

  <h2 class="medium"> 
        Week 3: Using a visualisation in economic commentary
    </h2>
<p> I considered an argument made at the Festival of Economics stating that Britain's export market should be improved to boost economic growth. To form my opinion on this statement I had to look at the UK's imports and exports. </p>

    <figure id="Location6"></figure>

 <script>
        
 let figure_6_spec = "XMgraph"; 
                                                                                                                  
    vegaEmbed('#Location6', figure_6_spec)
    
 </script>

<p> We can see from the diagram above the orange import line is consistently above the blue export line, meaning the UK regularly runs a trade deficit. This is shown more clearly by looking at the net trade, the difference between imports and exports, shown below: </p>

    <figure id="Location7"></figure>
    
<script>

 let figure_7_spec = "NetTradegraph"; 
                                                                                                                  
    vegaEmbed('#Location7', figure_7_spec)
    
 </script>

<p> As we can see the green trade balance line is consistently negative, only spiking into positives in 2020 and 2021. Therefore, it can be argued that there is a strong case to boost UK exports, creating economic growth. </p>

      <!-- WEEK 4 start -->

<h2 class="medium"> 
        Week 4: Recreating and improving someone elses chart
    </h2>

<p> I found a chart online showing the population of every country: </p>

<img src="bad data example.png" >

<p> This is my recreation of the chart: </p>  

        <figure id="Location9"></figure>
    
<script>

 let figure_9_spec = "countrypoprecreation"; 
                                                                                                                  
    vegaEmbed('#Location9', figure_9_spec)
    
 </script>

<p> This chart is messy, it shows population data for all 217 countries. By the time you're past the 10th largest country it's difficult to distinguish the difference between them. So, to tidy the chart up, I chose to display only the top 10 largest countries by population. I also added a title and a tooltip that shows the name of the country and the population when hovered over. This is my improved chart: </p>

        <figure id="Location10"></figure>
    
<script>

 let figure_10_spec = "improvedcountrypopgraph"; 
                                                                                                                  
    vegaEmbed('#Location10', figure_10_spec)
    
 </script>

<h2 class="medium"> 
        Week 5: Implementing a scraper
    </h2>
<p> I chose to scrape a website I found showing the number of pubs in each county of England, there was no clear way to download this data, so I thought a scraper would be an ideal tool to extract the data from this website.</p>

<p> I chose to display this data on a choropleth map, in order to practice creating maps for the Week 7 task. I tidied the data into regions and used a base map of the UK: </p>

    <figure id="Location8"></figure>
    
<script>

 let figure_8_spec = "UKpubsgraph";

    <p> For my choropleth map I used this base map of Germany I found on Github: </p>

    vegaEmbed('#Location11', figure_11_spec)

 </script>

<p> Base map taken from: <a href="https://github.com/AliceWi">github.com/AliceWi</a> </p>


<p> I used this base map to make a choropleth of the population of each German state: </p>

        <figure id="Location12"></figure>

<p> This chart shows that Nordhein-Westalfen has the largest population, but it is also much larger than somehwere with a smaller population, for example Bremen. Next time I make a graph like this I will divide the population by the square area of the region, giving me the population density rather than the population </p>
    
<script>

 let figure_12_spec = "germanypopgraph";

        Week 8: Advanced analytics charts

<p> For my first chart I plotted deaths by drug poisoning against the income deprivation in each local authority of England to see if there was any correlation. I learned how to construct scatter graphs and perform an OLS regression to find the R²: </p>

        <figure id="Location13"></figure>

 let figure_13_spec = "drugdeprivationgraph"; 
                                                                                                                  
    vegaEmbed('#Location13', figure_13_spec)

    <p> For my second chart I plotted two heatmaps of the average monthly temperature in two locations of the UK, the South West and North Scotland, over the past 30 years. I learned how to construct heat map graphs and also use verticle concatenations to display the two graphs above and below each other. </p>
