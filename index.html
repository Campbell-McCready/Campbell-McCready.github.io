        <p>Hi there, my name is Campbell McCready. I'm a second-year student at the University of Bristol currently studying BSc Economics. This website is made up of two sections, my Data Science 2024 portfolio, which consists of 10 coding challenges, and my project, which you can access my clicking the box in the top-right of this webpage. Over the course of this module I've learned many things and encountered many challenges. I've expanded my knowledge of coding and also the chosen topic of my project, the Drug Economy of the UK. Below you'll find my portfolio projects. </p>

                We can see above that obesity has risen dramatically, increasing from 15% to 28% in the last two decades.

            <p>
             Obesity is also more prevelant in disadvantaged parts of the country, figure 2 shows this, with 1 being the most deprived and 10 being the least. Data taken from the Economics Observatory study:<a href="https://www.economicsobservatory.com/why-should-we-care-about-obesity">Why should we care about obesity?</a>

<!-- WEEK 2 START -->
    
    <section class="chart-section">
        <h2> Week 2: Building your own visualisation </h2>
        <div class="card">
            <figure id="Location4"></figure>
            <p> I used data I gathered in my data science module last year covering the UK's life expectancy and GDP per capita. Using vega lite I created two diagrams. </p>
        </div>
         <div class="card">
            <figure id="Location5"></figure>
             <p> Because my data for life expectancy was only between 65 and 85 I had to use domains to prevent a large unnecessary gap on my graph.</p>
         </div>   
    </section>

 <!-- WEEK 3 start -->
    
    <section class="chart-section">
        <h2> Week 3: Using a visualisation in economic commentary </h2>
        <div class="card">
            <figure id="Location6"></figure>
            <p> I considered an argument made at the Festival of Economics stating that Britain's export market should be improved to boost economic growth. To form my opinion on this statement I had to look at the UK's imports and exports. We can see from the diagram above the orange import line is consistently above the blue export line, meaning the UK regularly runs a trade deficit. This is shown more clearly by looking at the net trade, the difference between imports and exports, shown on the second graph. </p>
        </div>
         <div class="card">
            <figure id="Location7"></figure>
             <p> As we can see the green trade balance line is consistently negative, only spiking into positives in 2020 and 2021. Therefore, it can be argued that there is a strong case to boost UK exports, creating economic growth.</p>

      <!-- WEEK 4 start -->

    <section class="chart-section">
        <h2> Week 4: Recreating and improving someone elses chart </h2>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="bad data example.png" >
            <p> I found a chart online showing the population of every country. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <figure id="Location9"></figure>
            <p> This is my recreation of the chart.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "card"> 
            <figure id="Location10"></figure>
            <p>The original chart is messy, it shows the population data for all 217 countries. By the time you're past the 10th largest country it's difficult to distinguish the difference between them. So, to tidy the chart I chose to display only the 10 countries with the largest population. I also added a title and a tooltip that shows the name of the country and the population when hovered over.</p>

  <!-- WEEK 5 start -->

<section class="chart-section">
    <h2> Week 5: Implementing a scraper </h2>
    <div class="card">
        <figure id="Location8"></figure>
        <p> I chose to scrape a website I found showing the number of pubs in each county of England, there was no clear way to download this data, so I thought a scraper would be an ideal tool to extract the data from this website.</p>

        <p> <a href="https://www.pubsgalore.co.uk/stats/photos-counties.php">Click here to view the website I scraped</a> </p>
        <p> I chose to display this data on a choropleth map, in order to practice creating maps for the Week 7 task. I tidied the data into regions and used a base map of the UK. </p>

        <h2> Week 7: Base maps and choropleths </h2>
        <div class="card">
            <figure id="Location11"></figure>
            <p> I found a base map of Germany on github that I used for my choropleth. </p>

        </div>
         <div class="card">
            <figure id="Location12"></figure>
             <p> I used this base map to make a choropleth of the population of each German state. This chart shows that Nordhein-Westalfen has the largest population, but it is also much larger than somehwere with a smaller population, for example Bremen. Next time I make a graph like this I will divide the population by the square area of the region, giving me the population density rather than the population. </p>

        <div class="card">
            <figure id="Location13"></figure>
            <p>For my first chart I plotted deaths by drug poisoning against the income deprivation in each local authority of England to see if there was any correlation. I learned how to construct scatter graphs and perform an OLS regression to find the RÂ². </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <figure id="Location14"></figure>
            <p> For my second chart I plotted two heatmaps of the average monthly temperature in two locations of the UK, the South West and North Scotland, over the past 30 years. I learned how to construct heat map graphs and also use verticle concatenations to display the two graphs above and below each other. </p>

            <p> For my first interactive visualisation I plotted a bar chart showing the use of certain drugs. I added a slider that allowes users to see the data from different years. I also added a condition that highlights a selected bar when the mouse is hovered over it. </p>
