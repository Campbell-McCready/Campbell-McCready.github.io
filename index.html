        Week 2: Building your own visualisation
    </h3>

<p> I used data I gathered in my data science module last year covering the UK's life expectancy and GDP per capita. Using vega lite I created two diagrams: 
    </p>

    <figure id="Location4"></figure> 

    </section>

 <script>
        

 let figure_4_spec = "GDPPC graph test"; 
                                                                                                                  
    vegaEmbed('#Location4', figure_4_spec)
    
 </script>

<p> Because my data for life expectancy was only between 65 and 85 I had to use domains to prevent a large unnecessary gap on my graph:
    </p>

    <figure id="Location5"></figure>

 let figure_5_spec = "Life exp test";
