    <h1 class="title">The Drug Economy of the UK: A study of the characteristics of drug use and how it impacts the UK Economy</h1>
</section>

<section>
    <div class="chart-description">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this research project I will present and discuss data for two main topics, the characteristics of drug use and the costs imposed on the UK economy by drug use. I will use multiple charts I’ve created on Vega-Lite using data from multiple sources such as the Office of National Statistics and the GOV.UK website. First, I will explore three possible characteristics of drug use to answer these questions:</p>
        <ul> 
        <li> How does drug use vary between age groups?</li>
        <li> Is there a correlation between drug use and income deprivation?</li>
        <li> Is there a correlation between drug use and student population?</li>
        </ul>
        <p> After analysing these characteristics and performing regressions on the second and third, I will use the R2 value to decide if there is sufficient evidence to suggest a correlation between my variables. </p>

        <h2>Drugs use in the UK</h2>
        <p>Before analysing the characteristics and costs, I will look at the main drugs that are used in the UK and the regions in which they are most prevalent. The chart below shows the estimated number of users of different illegal substances (excluding cannabis) between 2010 and 2021. The slider can be used to look at how the data differs from across these years and hovering over each bar will highlight the data:</p>

        <p>We can see that cocaine is consistently the second most consumed illegal substance, with other class A’s like hallucinogens and ecstasy not even reaching half the amount of consumption. Cannabis was excluded from this chart because its consumption was three times the average of cocaine, and many multiples higher than any of the other drugs. Along with the number of drugs used each year we can look at which regions use the most. Below is a choropleth map showing the proportion of the population that consumed illegal substances in 2023 in each region of England and Wales:</p>

    <div id="chartGrid">
        <figure class="chart" id="Location6"></figure>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>We can see that the South-West has the highest the highest proportion of drug use. This interested me, why would the South-West have a higher proportion of drug use than London, for example. After doing some research I discovered that a likely reason for this is due to ‘county lines’. This is a model of drug distribution in which metropolitan organised crime groups sell drugs in provincial areas. Because Cornwall, Devon and Somerset are some of the most rural counties in the UK, they’re ideal candidates for these tactics. Coastal towns with harbours such as Plymouth or Penzance are also vulnerable to overseas drug smuggling.</p>
        <p>We’ve now established that the UK has an issue with consumption of illegal substances but why? In the coming sections I’ll look at three different characteristics of drug use. </p>
