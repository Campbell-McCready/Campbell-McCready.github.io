    <h1 class="title">The Drug Economy of the UK: A study of the characteristics of drug use and how it impacts the UK Economy</h1>
</section>

<section>
    <div class="chart-description">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this research project I will present and discuss data for two main topics, the characteristics of drug use and the costs imposed on the UK economy by drug use. I will use multiple charts I’ve created on Vega-Lite using data from multiple sources such as the Office of National Statistics and the GOV.UK website. First, I will explore three possible characteristics of drug use to answer these questions:</p>
        <ul> 
        <li> How does drug use vary between age groups?</li>
        <li> Is there a correlation between drug use and income deprivation?</li>
        <li> Is there a correlation between drug use and student population?</li>
        </ul>
        <p> After analysing these characteristics and performing regressions on the second and third, I will use the R2 value to decide if there is sufficient evidence to suggest a correlation between my variables. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="chart-description">
        <h2>Drugs use in the UK</h2>
        <p>Before analysing the characteristics and costs, I will look at the main drugs that are used in the UK and the regions in which they are most prevalent. The chart below shows the estimated number of users of different illegal substances (excluding cannabis) between 2010 and 2021. The slider can be used to look at how the data differs from across these years and hovering over each bar will highlight the data:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="chartGrid">
        <figure class="chart" id="Location1"></figure> 
    </div>
    <div> 
        <p>We can see that cocaine is consistently the second most consumed illegal substance, with other class A’s like hallucinogens and ecstasy not even reaching half the amount of consumption. Cannabis was excluded from this chart because its consumption was three times the average of cocaine, and many multiples higher than any of the other drugs. Along with the number of drugs used each year we can look at which regions use the most. Below is a choropleth map showing the proportion of the population that consumed illegal substances in 2023 in each region of England and Wales:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="chartGrid">
        <figure class="chart" id="Location6"></figure>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>We can see that the South-West has the highest the highest proportion of drug use. This interested me, why would the South-West have a higher proportion of drug use than London, for example. After doing some research I discovered that a likely reason for this is due to ‘county lines’. This is a model of drug distribution in which metropolitan organised crime groups sell drugs in provincial areas. Because Cornwall, Devon and Somerset are some of the most rural counties in the UK, they’re ideal candidates for these tactics. Coastal towns with harbours such as Plymouth or Penzance are also vulnerable to overseas drug smuggling.</p>
        <p>We’ve now established that the UK has an issue with consumption of illegal substances but why? In the coming sections I’ll look at three different characteristics of drug use. </p>

    <div class="chart-description">
        <h2>How does drug use vary between age groups?</h2>
        <p>The first characteristic I’ll analyse is age. The graph below shows the proportion of drug users across seven groups in the working age range. You can use the sliders to see the change in trends over different years, and hovering over the lines will tell you the data for each age group in a given year:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="chartGrid">
            <figure class="chart" id="Location2"></figure> 
    </div>
    <div> 
           <p>The graph tells us that the two youngest age groups, 16-19 and 20-24, consistently have the highest proportion of drug users. But why? Teenagers and young adults are likely to be surrounded by groups of other people their age who are beginning to experiment with drinking, smoking and drugs. Individuals can feel peer pressured to ‘look cool’ and do drugs in order fit in with their peers, leading to addiction. Another reason could be the increase in depression in the 16-24 age group, caused by the rising cost of living and recent COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals may use drug as an escape method to deal with their mental issues. Another reason could be that this is the university age range, which is commonly associated with drinking and drug use, I discuss this further in a later section.  </p>

    <div class="chart-description">
        <h2>Is drug use correlated with income deprivation?</h2>
        <p>The British Medical Association states that there is a strong association between socioeconomic position and illegal drug use. To test this, I used local income deprivation data from the ONS and plotted it against the number of drug-related deaths in each area. This data uses an income deprivation ‘score’ that takes the average number of income deprived people in a local authority proportional to the population. The lower the score, the less people who are income deprived. For example, Wokingham has a score of just 0.044, meaning it is on average considerably less income deprived than Blackpool, which has a score of 0.247.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="chartGrid">
            <figure class="chart" id="Location3"></figure> 
    </div>
    <div> 
           <p>The line-of-best-fit is upwards sloping, suggesting that there is a positive correlation between income deprivation and drug-related deaths; as one grows, so does the other. Manchester, Liverpool and Blackpool are all standouts, having both a large number of drug related deaths and a high proportion of income depravity. The R2 value is 0.31, which suggests that although there is a correlation, it’s a fairly weak one. </p>
    </div>

 <section>
    <div class="chart-description">
        <h2>Is drug use correlated with student population?</h2>
        <p>The correlation between lower-income areas and drug use is fairly accepted in society, but I wanted to test one of my own theories. As I mentioned previously I believe that a possible characteristic of drug use is social setting, specifically university. Those at university are more likely to meet a wider group of people, and are more likely to be in big cities where drug use is more prevalent. To test this, I plotted the same number of drug-related deaths against the student population of large university cities. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="chartGrid">
            <figure class="chart" id="Location4"></figure> 
    </div>
    <div> 
           <p>This data shows a line-of-best-fit with a much steeper gradient, and a larger R2 value of 0.42. Initially, I saw this as evidence to support my statement, but the more I thought about it, the more I considered a key omitted variable, population. I was regressing drug-deaths against student population, but a university in a large city is inevitably going to have more drug-related deaths due to the higher population. To solve this, I divided the student population of each city by the total population, giving the proportion of students in each city. I then ran the same regression as before: </p>
    </div>
         <div id="chartGrid">
            <figure class="chart" id="Location5"></figure> 
    </div>
     <div>
            <p>The R2 of this graph is close to zero, suggesting there is little-to-no correlation. Along with this, the line-of-best-fit is downwards sloping, so even if the data was more correlated, it would suggest that as proportion of students grow, drug-related deaths decrease. This was sufficient evidence to disprove my theory, though in the future I’d like to perform more regressions on this topic using a 2SLS regression allowing me to include other omitted variables that I haven’t covered in this research study. </p>

 <section>
    <div class="chart-description">
        <h2>What is the cost of drug consumption to the UK economy?</h2>
        <p>The UK’s drug market imposes serious costs on the economy in a multitude of ways. These costs include:</p>
        <ul> 
        <li> Drug-related crime: costs incurred from crimes committed by individuals under the influence of drugs.</li>
        <li> Costs to the NHS: These include the treatment of drug-related mental and behavioural disorders, drug overdoses, neonatal effects (foetuses and new-borns affected by maternal drug use) and IDU (the treatment of hepatitis-C and AIDS from needle use). </li>
        <li> Drug-related deaths.</li>
        <li> Drug treatment costs.</li>
        <li> Enforcement costs. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below we can see these costs broken down into a pie chart:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="chartGrid">
            <figure class="chart" id="Location7"></figure> 
    </div>
    <div> 
           <p>We can also split these costs down further to analyse the secondary costs that make up the total cost: </p>
    </div>
         <div id="chartGrid">
            <figure class="chart" id="Location8"></figure> 
    </div>
        <div>
            <p>If the government want to prevent further costs, they must focus on these key components and devise strategies to solve the issues. For example, if we use our characteristics from earlier, the government can introduce educational and cautionary material targeted at the 16-24 age range to encourage them to resist drug use. They could also focus on supporting less deprived communities to prevent drug use from becoming a more serious issue.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>To conclude, we’ve successfully proven that younger people tend to consume more illegal drugs, and also proved there is a positive correlation between income deprivation and drug use. We’ve also rejected the assumption that there is a correlation between university student population and drug use. Finally, we’ve broken down the multiple costs drug use imposes on the UK’s economy, and discussed strategies the government could introduce to combat the use of illegal substances, improving both social welfare and the economy.</p>
